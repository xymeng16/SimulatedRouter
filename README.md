# SimulatedRouter
## Introduction
This simple program simulates the algorithm used in RIP(Router Information Protocol:[RFC 1058](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1058)).
## Usage
Just compile it in any \*nix operating system and execute it in the shell without any parameter.  
For convenience, I wrote a shell script for you to help you compile this source code(*Please make sure that g++ is available in your computer*).
